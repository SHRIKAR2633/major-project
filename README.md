# Introduction:
The proliferation of electronic devices in modern society has led to a corresponding surge in electronic waste (e-waste), presenting a pressing environmental and health challenge. E-waste comprises discarded electronic devices and components, including old computers, mobile phones, batteries, and circuit boards, among others. Improper handling and disposal of e-waste can lead to pollution, toxic substance exposure, and resource wastage. Addressing these challenges requires effective e-waste management strategies, including accurate identification and classification of e-waste items.

Traditional methods of e-waste classification often involve manual inspection and sorting, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to errors. With the advancements in computer vision and deep learning, automated image classification systems offer a promising solution to streamline the e-waste classification process. By leveraging large-scale image datasets and sophisticated deep learning models, it becomes possible to develop robust systems capable of accurately categorizing e-waste items into different classes.

In this project, we focus on harnessing the power of deep learning techniques, specifically pre-trained Vision Transformer models, for e-waste image classification. Vision Transformers have emerged as a state-of-the-art architecture for image recognition tasks, excelling at capturing global relationships within images. By fine-tuning a pre-trained Vision Transformer model using transfer learning, we aim to adapt it to the specific task of e-waste classification. Transfer learning allows us to leverage the knowledge learned by the pre-trained model on a large-scale dataset and apply it to a related but distinct task with a smaller dataset.

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate e-waste image classification system that can automatically categorize e-waste items into different classes. By automating the classification process, we can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of e-waste management and recycling efforts, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future.
